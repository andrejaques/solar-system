# solar-system-project
3D Solar System developed with ThreeJS.

## Use the mouse to navigate.

## Scale:

### The measurements are taking Earth size as reference. 

* Sun and planets are in sizes 1:1;
* The distance from the planets to the sun is in scale 1:100;
* Translation speed is in scale 1:300.000
* Rotation Speed is out of scale (just representative)

## OBS: 

### It was implemented just the planets not dwarf planets;

### To replicate just need to copy everything and open the index.html.

### Use to study. The code is commented in every part.
